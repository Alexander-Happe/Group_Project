HOW IT WORKS:
This is a grocery planning and shopping app that uses the Edamam API to look up dishes.

The user can search for preferred dishes or add their own manually into the shopping list box. Once a user has searched for a dish,
the page will generate several options. From there they can follow a link to the blog the dish came from, or they can add the dish
to their meals for the week box along with the needed ingredients into the shopping list.

All items in the shopping list will be saved in local storage, so if the user returns to the page later their choices will be retained.
The user can also delete specific items from the shopping list (this will also delete them from local storage) and they can click
the items to 'cross' them out if they so choose.
